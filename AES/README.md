# AES 128 bit encryption 
AES encryption implemented for the course Applied Cryptography â€“ DD2520

## Quick rundown of the code implemented

1. Main
* Read 16 bytes from stdin (the first 16 bytes contains the cipher key for AES.)
* Expand the cipher key with the key_expansion_128bit function and return a list of lists containing 44 lists representing 11 4x4 matrices that contains the round keys for AES.
* Read 16 bytes from stdin and send the bytes with the round keys to the encrypt_128bit function to encrypt according to AES. Repeat until no more bytes left of plaintext.

2. Key expansion
 
* The key_expansion_128bit function receives 16 raw bytes representing the secret key.
* The function returns keys, a list of lists. 
* Each list contains 4 elements. Every element is an integer representing a byte (0-255).
* 4 consecutive lists give us a 4x4 matrix representation of 16 bytes. In total, keys contain 44 lists, representing 11 matrices (the roundkeys according to AES 128 bit).

Algorithm:
  * Store the initial cipher key without modification in keys.
  * for i in range (0,40):
    * Grab the current last list in keys.
    * Whenever we begin with a new round key, modify the last list (the last 4 bytes of the 4x4 matrix) according to AES:
      * Do RotWord()
      * Do SubWord()
      * Do Rcon
    * xor the last list with the current i list
   
When the loop is completed, keys should have 44 lists, the first 4 represents the original cipher key, the next 40 the derived round keys.
return the list keys.
