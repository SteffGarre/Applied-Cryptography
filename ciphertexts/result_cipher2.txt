HOW HAPPY I AM THAT I AM GONE MY DEAR FRIEND WHAT A THING IS THE HEART OF MAN TO LEAVE YOU FROM WHOM I HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE WHOM I LOVE SO DEARLY AND YET TO FEEL HAPPY I KNOW YOU WILL FORGIVE ME HAVE NOT OTHER ATTACHMENTS BEEN SPECIALLY APPOINTED BY FATE TO TORMENT A HEAD LIKE MINE POOR LEONORA AND YET I WAS NOT TO BLAME WAS IT MY FAULT THAT WHILST THE PECULIAR CHARMS OF HER SISTER AFFORDED ME AN AGREEABLE ENTERTAINMENT A PASSION FOR ME WAS ENGENDERED IN HER FEEBLE HEART AND YET AM I WHOLLY BLAMELESS DID I NOT ENCOURAGE HER EMOTIONS DID I NOT FEEL CHARMED AT THOSE TRULY GENUINE EXPRESSIONS OF NATURE WHICH THOUGH BUT LITTLE MIRTHFUL IN REALITY SO OFTEN AMUSED US DID I NOT  BUT OH WHAT IS MAN THAT HE DARES SO TO ACCUSE HIMSELF MY DEAR FRIEND I PROMISE YOU I WILL IMPROVE I WILL NO LONGER AS HAS EVER BEEN MY HABIT CONTINUE TO RUMINATE ON EVERY PETTY VEXATION WHICH FORTUNE MAY DISPENSE I WILL ENJOY THE PRESENT AND THE PAST SHALL BE FOR ME THE PAST NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT MY BEST OF FRIENDS THERE WOULD BE FAR LESS SUFFERING AMONGST MANKIND IF MEN  AND GOD KNOWS WHY THEY ARE SO FASHIONED  DID NOT EMPLOY THEIR IMAGINATIONS SO ASSIDUOUSLY IN RECALLING THE MEMORY OF PAST SORROW INSTEAD OF BEARING THEIR PRESENT LOT WITH EQUANIMITY BE KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM MY MOTHER THAT I SHALL ATTEND TO HER BUSINESS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND SHALL GIVE HER THE EARLIEST INFORMATION ABOUT IT I HAVE SEEN MY AUNT AND FIND THAT SHE IS VERY FAR FROM BEING THE DISAGREEABLE PERSON OUR FRIENDS ALLEGE HER TO BE SHE IS A LIVELY CHEERFUL WOMAN WITH THE BEST OF HEARTS I EXPLAINED TO HER MY MOTHERS WRONGS WITH REGARD TO THAT PART OF HER PORTION WHICH HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM HER SHE TOLD ME THE MOTIVES AND REASONS OF HER OWN CONDUCT AND THE TERMS ON WHICH SHE IS WILLING TO GIVE UP THE WHOLE AND TO DO MORE THAN WE HAVE ASKED IN SHORT I CANNOT WRITE FURTHER UPON THIS SUBJECT AT PRESENT ONLY ASSURE MY MOTHER THAT ALL WILL GO ON WELL AND I HAVE AGAIN OBSERVED MY DEAR FRIEND IN THIS TRIFLING AFFAIR THAT MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND NEGLECT OCCASION MORE MISCHIEF IN THE WORLD THAN EVEN MALICE AND WICKEDNESS AT ALL EVENTS THE TWO LATTER ARE OF LESS FREQUENT OCCURRENCE  IN OTHER RESPECTS I AM VERY WELL OFF HERE SOLITUDE IN THIS TERRESTRIAL PARADISE IS A GENIAL BALM TO MY MIND AND THE YOUNG SPRING CHEERS WITH ITS BOUNTEOUS PROMISES MY OFTENTIMES MISGIVING HEART EVERY TREE EVERY BUSH IS FULL OF FLOWERS AND ONE MIGHT WISH HIMSELF TRANSFORMED INTO A BUTTERFLY TO FLOAT ABOUT IN THIS OCEAN OF PERFUME AND FIND HIS WHOLE EXISTENCE IN IT  THE TOWN ITSELF IS DISAGREEABLE BUT THEN ALL AROUND YOU FIND AN INEXPRESSIBLE BEAUTY OF NATURE THIS INDUCED THE LATE COUNT M TO LAY OUT A GARDEN ON ONE OF THE SLOPING HILLS WHICH HERE INTERSECT EACH OTHER WITH THE MOST CHARMING VARIETY AND FORM THE MOST LOVELY VALLEYS THE GARDEN IS SIMPLE AND IT IS EASY TO PERCEIVE EVEN UPON YOUR FIRST ENTRANCE THAT THE PLAN WAS NOT DESIGNED BY A SCIENTIFIC GARDENER BUT BY A MAN WHO WISHED TO GIVE HIMSELF UP HERE TO THE ENJOYMENT OF HIS OWN SENSITIVE HEART MANY A TEAR HAVE I ALREADY SHED TO THE MEMORY OF ITS DEPARTED MASTER IN A SUMMER HOUSE WHICH IS NOW REDUCED TO RUINS BUT WAS HIS FAVOURITE RESORT AND NOW IS MINE I SHALL SOON BE MASTER OF THE PLACE THE GARDENER HAS BECOME ATTACHED TO ME WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND HE WILL LOSE NOTHING THEREBY  MAY 10  A WONDERFUL SERENITY HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY ENTIRE SOUL LIKE THESE SWEET MORNINGS OF SPRING WHICH I ENJOY WITH MY WHOLE HEART I AM ALONE AND FEEL THE CHARM OF EXISTENCE IN THIS SPOT WHICH WAS CREATED FOR THE BLISS OF SOULS LIKE MINE I AM SO HAPPY MY DEAR FRIEND SO ABSORBED IN THE EXQUISITE SENSE OF MERE TRANQUIL EXISTENCE THAT I NEGLECT MY TALENTS I SHOULD BE INCAPABLE OF DRAWING A SINGLE STROKE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AND YET I FEEL THAT I NEVER WAS A GREATER ARTIST THAN NOW WHEN WHILE THE LOVELY VALLEY TEEMS WITH VAPOUR AROUND ME AND THE MERIDIAN SUN STRIKES THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE IMPENETRABLE FOLIAGE OF MY TREES AND BUT A FEW STRAY GLEAMS STEAL INTO THE INNER SANCTUARY I THROW MYSELF DOWN AMONG THE TALL GRASS BY THE TRICKLING STREAM AND AS I LIE CLOSE TO THE EARTH A THOUSAND UNKNOWN PLANTS ARE NOTICED BY ME WHEN I HEAR THE BUZZ OF THE LITTLE WORLD AMONG THE STALKS AND GROW FAMILIAR WITH THE COUNTLESS INDESCRIBABLE FORMS OF THE INSECTS AND FLIES THEN I FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY WHO FORMED US IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND THE BREATH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LOVE WHICH BEARS AND SUSTAINS US AS IT FLOATS AROUND US IN AN ETERNITY OF BLISS AND THEN MY FRIEND WHEN DARKNESS OVERSPREADS MY EYES AND HEAVEN AND EARTH SEEM TO DWELL IN MY SOUL AND ABSORB ITS POWER LIKE THE FORM OF A BELOVED MISTRESS THEN I OFTEN THINK WITH LONGING OH WOULD I COULD DESCRIBE THESE CONCEPTIONS COULD IMPRESS UPON PAPER ALL THAT IS LIVING SO FULL AND WARM WITHIN ME THAT IT MIGHT BE THE MIRROR OF MY SOUL AS MY SOUL IS THE MIRROR OF THE INFINITE GOD O MY FRIEND  BUT IT IS TOO MUCH FOR MY STRENGTH  I SINK UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE SPLENDOUR OF THESE VISIONS  MAY 12  I KNOW NOT WHETHER SOME DECEITFUL SPIRITS HAUNT THIS SPOT OR WHETHER IT BE THE WARM CELESTIAL FANCY IN MY OWN HEART WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING AROUND ME SEEM LIKE PARADISE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE IS A FOUNTAIN  A FOUNTAIN TO WHICH I AM BOUND BY A CHARM LIKE MELUSINA AND HER SISTERS DESCENDING A GENTLE SLOPE YOU COME TO AN ARCH WHERE SOME TWENTY STEPS LOWER DOWN WATER OF THE CLEAREST CRYSTAL GUSHES FROM THE MARBLE ROCK THE NARROW WALL WHICH ENCLOSES IT ABOVE THE TALL TREES WHICH ENCIRCLE THE SPOT AND THE COOLNESS OF THE PLACE ITSELF  EVERYTHING IMPARTS A PLEASANT BUT SUBLIME IMPRESSION NOT A DAY PASSES ON WHICH I DO NOT SPEND AN HOUR THERE THE YOUNG MAIDENS COME FROM THE TOWN TO FETCH WATER  INNOCENT AND NECESSARY EMPLOYMENT AND FORMERLY THE OCCUPATION OF THE DAUGHTERS OF KINGS AS I TAKE MY REST THERE THE IDEA OF THE OLD PATRIARCHAL LIFE IS AWAKENED AROUND ME I SEE THEM OUR OLD ANCESTORS HOW THEY FORMED THEIR FRIENDSHIPS AND CONTRACTED ALLIANCES AT THE FOUNTAIN SIDE AND I FEEL HOW FOUNTAINS AND STREAMS WERE GUARDED BY BENEFICENT SPIRITS HE WHO IS A STRANGER TO THESE SENSATIONS HAS NEVER REALLY ENJOYED COOL REPOSE AT THE SIDE OF A FOUNTAIN AFTER THE FATIGUE OF A WEARY SUMMER DAY  MAY 13  YOU ASK IF YOU SHALL SEND ME BOOKS MY DEAR FRIEND I BESEECH YOU FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RELIEVE ME FROM SUCH A YOKE I NEED NO MORE TO BE GUIDED AGITATED HEATED MY HEART FERMENTS SUFFICIENTLY OF ITSELF I WANT STRAINS TO LULL ME AND I FIND THEM TO PERFECTION IN MY HOMER OFTEN DO I STRIVE TO ALLAY THE BURNING FEVER OF MY BLOOD AND YOU HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING SO UNSTEADY SO UNCERTAIN AS MY HEART BUT NEED I CONFESS THIS TO YOU MY DEAR FRIEND WHO HAVE SO OFTEN ENDURED THE ANGUISH OF WITNESSING MY SUDDEN TRANSITIONS FROM SORROW TO IMMODERATE JOY AND FROM SWEET MELANCHOLY TO VIOLENT PASSIONS I TREAT MY POOR HEART LIKE A SICK CHILD AND GRATIFY ITS EVERY FANCY DO NOT MENTION THIS AGAIN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD CENSURE ME FOR IT  MAY 15  THE COMMON PEOPLE OF THE PLACE KNOW ME ALREADY AND LOVE ME PARTICULARLY THE CHILDREN WHEN AT FIRST I ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND INQUIRED IN A FRIENDLY TONE ABOUT THEIR VARIOUS TRIFLES SOME FANCIED THAT I WISHED TO RIDICULE THEM AND TURNED FROM ME IN EXCEEDING ILL HUMOUR I DID NOT ALLOW THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TO GRIEVE ME I ONLY FELT MOST KEENLY WHAT I HAVE OFTEN BEFORE OBSERVED PERSONS WHO CAN CLAIM A CERTAIN RANK KEEP THEMSELVES COLDLY ALOOF FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE AS THOUGH THEY FEARED TO LOSE THEIR IMPORTANCE BY THE CONTACT WHILST WANTON IDLERS AND SUCH AS ARE PRONE TO BAD JOKING AFFECT TO DESCEND TO THEIR LEVEL ONLY TO MAKE THE POOR PEOPLE FEEL THEIR IMPERTINENCE ALL THE MORE KEENLY  I KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE ARE NOT ALL EQUAL NOR CAN BE SO BUT IT IS MY OPINION THAT HE WHO AVOIDS THE COMMON PEOPLE IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE THEIR RESPECT IS AS MUCH TO BLAME AS A COWARD WHO HIDES HIMSELF FROM HIS ENEMY BECAUSE HE FEARS DEFEAT  THE OTHER DAY I WENT TO THE FOUNTAIN AND FOUND A YOUNG SERVANT GIRL WHO HAD SET HER PITCHER ON THE LOWEST STEP AND LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF ONE OF HER COMPANIONS WAS APPROACHING TO PLACE IT ON HER HEAD I RAN DOWN AND LOOKED AT HER SHALL I HELP YOU PRETTY LASS SAID I SHE BLUSHED DEEPLY OH SIR SHE EXCLAIMED NO CEREMONY I REPLIED SHE ADJUSTED HER HEAD GEAR AND I HELPED HER SHE THANKED ME AND ASCENDED THE STEPS  MAY 17  I HAVE MADE ALL SORTS OF ACQUAINTANCES BUT HAVE AS YET FOUND NO SOCIETY I KNOW NOT WHAT ATTRACTION I POSSESS FOR THE PEOPLE SO MANY OF THEM LIKE ME AND ATTACH THEMSELVES TO ME AND THEN I FEEL SORRY WHEN THE ROAD WE PURSUE TOGETHER GOES ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE IF YOU INQUIRE WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE HERE I MUST ANSWER THE SAME AS EVERYWHERE THE HUMAN RACE IS BUT A MONOTONOUS AFFAIR MOST OF THEM LABOUR THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME FOR MERE SUBSISTENCE AND THE SCANTY PORTION OF FREEDOM WHICH REMAINS TO THEM SO TROUBLES THEM THAT THEY USE EVERY EXERTION TO GET RID OF IT OH THE DESTINY OF MAN  BUT THEY ARE A RIGHT GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE IF I OCCASIONALLY FORGET MYSELF AND TAKE PART IN THE INNOCENT PLEASURES WHICH ARE NOT YET FORBIDDEN TO THE PEASANTRY AND ENJOY MYSELF FOR INSTANCE WITH GENUINE FREEDOM AND SINCERITY ROUND A WELL COVERED TABLE OR ARRANGE AN EXCURSION OR A DANCE OPPORTUNELY AND SO FORTH ALL THIS PRODUCES A GOOD EFFECT UPON MY DISPOSITION ONLY I MUST FORGET THAT THERE LIE DORMANT WITHIN ME SO MANY OTHER QUALITIES WHICH MOULDER USELESSLY AND WHICH I AM OBLIGED TO KEEP CAREFULLY CONCEALED AH THIS THOUGHT AFFECTS MY SPIRITS FEARFULLY AND YET TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD IS THE FATE OF THE LIKE OF US  ALAS THAT THE FRIEND OF MY YOUTH IS GONE ALAS THAT I EVER KNEW HER I MIGHT SAY TO MYSELF YOU ARE A DREAMER TO SEEK WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND HERE BELOW BUT SHE HAS BEEN MINE I HAVE POSSESSED THAT HEART THAT NOBLE SOUL IN WHOSE PRESENCE I SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN I REALLY WAS BECAUSE I WAS ALL THAT I COULD BE GOOD HEAVENS DID THEN A SINGLE POWER OF MY SOUL REMAIN UNEXERCISED IN HER PRESENCE COULD I NOT DISPLAY TO ITS FULL EXTENT THAT MYSTERIOUS FEELING WITH WHICH MY HEART EMBRACES NATURE WAS NOT OUR INTERCOURSE A PERPETUAL WEB OF THE FINEST EMOTIONS OF THE KEENEST WIT THE VARIETIES OF WHICH EVEN IN THEIR VERY ECCENTRICITY BORE THE STAMP OF GENIUS ALAS THE FEW YEARS BY WHICH SHE WAS MY SENIOR BROUGHT HER TO THE GRAVE BEFORE ME NEVER CAN I FORGET HER FIRM MIND OR HER HEAVENLY PATIENCE  A FEW DAYS AGO I MET A CERTAIN YOUNG V   A FRANK OPEN FELLOW WITH A MOST PLEASING COUNTENANCE HE HAS JUST LEFT THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT DEEM HIMSELF OVERWISE BUT BELIEVES HE KNOWS MORE THAN OTHER P
