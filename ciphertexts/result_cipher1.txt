BETTER GEAR THAN GOOD SENSE A TRAVELLER CANNOT CARRY BETTER THAN RICHES FOR A WRETCHED MAN FAR FROM HIS OWN HOME
BETTER GEAR THAN GOOD SENSE A TRAVELLER CANNOT CARRY A MORE TEDIOUS BURDEN THAN TOO MUCH DRINK A TRAVELLER CANNOT CARRY
LESS GOOD THAN BELIEF WOULD HAVE IT IS MEAD FOR THE SONS OF MEN A MAN KNOWS LESS THE MORE HE DRINKS BECOMES A BEFUDDLED FOOL
IFORGET IS THE NAME MEN GIVE THE HERON WHO HOVERS OVER THE FAST FETTERED I WAS IN HIS FEATHERS THAT NIGHT WHEN A GUEST IN GUNNLODS COURT
DRUNK I GOT DEAD DRUNK WHEN FJALAR THE WISE WAS WITH ME BEST IS THE BANQUET ONE LOOKS BACK ON AFTER AND REMEMBERS ALL THAT HAPPENED
SILENCE BECOMES THE SON OF A PRINCE TO BE SILENT BUT BRAVE IN BATTLE IT BEFITS A MAN TO BE MERRY AND GLAD UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
THE COWARD BELIEVES HE WILL LIVE FOREVER IF HE HOLDS BACK IN THE BATTLE BUT IN OLD AGE HE SHALL HAVE NO PEACE THOUGH SPEARS HAVE SPARED HIS LIMBS
WHEN HE MEETS FRIENDS THE FOOL GAPES IS SHY AND SHEEPISH AT FIRST THEN HE SIPS HIS MEAD AND IMMEDIATELY ALL KNOW WHAT AN OAF HE IS HE WHO HAS SEEN AND SUFFERED MUCH AND KNOWS THE WAYS OF THE WORLD WHO HAS TRAVELLED CAN TELL WHAT SPIRIT GOVERNS THE MEN HE MEETS DRINK YOUR MEAD BUT IN MODERATION TALK SENSE OR BE SILENT NO MAN IS CALLED DISCOURTEOUS WHO GOES TO BED AT AN EARLY HOUR
A GLUTTONOUS MAN WHO GUZZLES AWAY BRINGS SORROW ON HIMSELF AT THE TABLE OF THE WISE HE IS TAUNTED OFTEN MOCKED FOR HIS BLOATED BELLY
THE HERD KNOWS ITS HOMING TIME AND LEAVES THE GRAZING GROUND BUT THE GLUTTON NEVER KNOWS HOW MUCH HIS BELLY IS ABLE TO HOLD
AN ILL TEMPERED UNHAPPY MAN RIDICULES ALL HE HEARS MAKES FUN OF OTHERS REFUSING ALWAYS TO SEE THE FAULTS IN HIMSELF
FOOLISH IS HE WHO FRETS AT NIGHT AND LIES AWAKE TO WORRY A WEARY MAN WHEN MORNING COMES HE FINDS ALL AS BAD AS BEFORE
THE FOOL THINKS THAT THOSE WHO LAUGH AT HIM ARE ALL HIS FRIENDS UNAWARE WHEN HE SITS WITH WISER MEN HOW ILL THEY SPEAK OF HIM
THE FOOL THINKS THAT THOSE WHO LAUGH AT HIM ARE ALL HIS FRIENDS WHEN HE COMES TO THE THING AND CALLS FOR SUPPORT FEW SPOKESMEN HE FINDS
THE FOOL WHO FANCIES HE IS FULL OF WISDOM WHILE HE SITS BY HIS HEARTH AT HOME QUICKLY FINDS WHEN QUESTIONED BY OTHERS THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING AT ALL
THE IGNORANT BOOBY HAD BEST BE SILENT WHEN HE MOVES AMONG OTHER MEN NO ONE WILL KNOW WHAT A NITWIT HE IS UNTIL HE BEGINS TO TALK NO ONE KNOWS LESS WHAT A NITWIT HE IS THAN THE MAN WHO TALKS TOO MUCH
TO ASK WELL TO ANSWER RIGHTLY ARE THE MARKS OF A WISE MAN MEN MUST SPEAK OF MENS DEEDS WHAT HAPPENS MAY NOT BE HIDDEN
WISE IS HE NOT WHO IS NEVER SILENT MOUTHING MEANINGLESS WORDS A GLIB TONGUE THAT GOES ON CHATTERING SINGS TO ITS OWN HARM
A MAN AMONG FRIENDS SHOULD NOT MOCK ANOTHER MANY BELIEVE THE MAN WHO IS NOT QUESTIONED TO KNOW MUCH AND SO HE ESCAPES THEIR SCORN AN EARLY MEAL A MAN SHOULD TAKE BEFORE HE VISITS FRIENDS LEST WHEN HE GETS THERE HE GO HUNGRY AFRAID TO ASK FOR FOOD
THE FASTEST FRIENDS MAY FALL OUT WHEN THEY SIT AT THE BANQUETBOARD IT IS AND SHALL BE A SHAMEFUL THING WHEN GUEST QUARRELS WITH GUEST
THE WISE GUEST HAS HIS WAY OF DEALING WITH THOSE WHO TAUNT HIM AT TABLE HE SMILES THROUGH THE MEAL NOT SEEMING TO HEAR THE TWADDLE TALKED BY HIS FOES
THE TACTFUL GUEST WILL TAKE HIS LEAVE EARLY NOT LINGER LONG HE STARTS TO STINK WHO OUTSTAYS HIS WELCOME IN A HALL THAT IS NOT HIS OWN
A SMALL HUT OF ONE S OWN IS BETTER A MAN IS HIS MASTER AT HOME A COUPLE OF GOATS AND A CORDED ROOF STILL ARE BETTER THAN BEGGING
A SMALL HUT OF ONES OWN IS BETTER A MAN IS HIS MASTER AT HOME HIS HEART BLEEDS IN THE BEGGAR WHO MUST ASK AT EACH MEAL FOR MEAT
A WAYFARER SHOULD NOT WALK UNARMED BUT HAVE HIS WEAPONS TO HAND HE KNOWS NOT WHEN HE MAY NEED A SPEAR OR WHAT MENACE MEET ON THE ROAD
NO MAN IS SO GENEROUS HE WILL JIB AT ACCEPTING A GIFT IN RETURN FOR A GIFT NO MAN SO RICH THAT IT REALLY GIVES HIM PAIN TO BE REPAID
ONCE HE HAS WON WEALTH ENOUGH A MAN SHOULD NOT CRAVE FOR MORE WHAT HE SAVES FOR FRIENDS FOES MAY TAKE HOPES ARE OFTEN LIARS
WITH PRESENTS FRIENDS SHOULD PLEASE EACH OTHER WITH A SHIELD OR A COSTLY COAT MUTUAL GIVING MAKES FOR FRIENDSHIP SO LONG AS LIFE GOES WELL A MAN SHOULD BE LOYAL THROUGH LIFE TO FRIENDS TO THEM AND TO FRIENDS OF THEIRS BUT NEVER SHALL A MAN MAKE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP TO HIS FOES
A MAN SHOULD BE LOYAL THROUGH LIFE TO FRIENDS AND RETURN GIFT FOR GIFT LAUGH WHEN THEY LAUGH BUT WITH LIES REPAY A FALSE FOE WHO LIES
IF YOU FIND A FRIEND YOU FULLY TRUST AND WISH FOR HIS GOODWILL EXCHANGE THOUGHTS EXCHANGE GIFTS GO OFTEN TO HIS HOUSE
IF YOU DEAL WITH ANOTHER YOU DONT TRUST BUT WISH FOR HIS GOODWILL BE FAIR IN SPEECH BUT FALSE IN THOUGHT AND GIVE HIM LIE FOR LIE
EVEN WITH ONE YOU ILLTRUST AND DOUBT WHAT HE MEANS TO DO FALSE WORDS WITH FAIR SMILES MAY GET YOU THE GIFT YOU DESIRE
TO A FALSE FRIEND THE FOOTPATH WINDS THOUGH HIS HOUSE BE ON THE HIGHWAY TO A SURE FRIEND THERE IS A SHORT CUT THOUGH HE LIVE A LONG WAY OFF
HOTTER THAN FIRE AMONG FALSE HEARTS BURNS FRIENDSHIP FOR FIVE DAYS BUT SUDDENLY SLACKENS WHEN THE SIXTH DAWNS FEEBLE THEIR FRIENDSHIP THEN
THE GENEROUS AND BOLD HAVE THE BEST LIVES ARE SELDOM BESET BY CARES BUT THE BASE MAN SEES BOGIES EVERYWHERE AND THE MISER PINES FOR PRESENTS
THE YOUNG FIR THAT FALLS AND ROTS HAVING NEITHER NEEDLES NOR BARK SO IS THE FATE OF THE FRIENDLESS MAN WHY SHOULD HE LIVE LONG
LITTLE A SANDGRAIN LITTLE A DEW DROP LITTLE THE MINDS OF MEN ALL MEN ARE NOT EQUAL IN WISDOM THE HALFWISE ARE EVERYWHERE
IT IS BEST FOR MAN TO BE MIDDLEWISE NOT OVER CUNNING AND CLEVER THE FAIREST LIFE IS LED BY THOSE WHO ARE DEFT AT ALL THEY DO IT IS BEST FOR MAN TO BE MIDDLEWISE NOT OVER CUNNING AND CLEVER NO MAN IS ABLE TO KNOW HIS FUTURE SO LET HIM SLEEP IN PEACE
IT IS BEST FOR MAN TO BE MIDDLEWISE NOT OVER CUNNING AND CLEVER THE LEARNED MAN WHOSE LORE IS DEEP IS SELDOM HAPPY AT HEART
BRAND KINDLES BRAND TILL THEY BURN OUT FLAME IS QUICKENED BY FLAME ONE MAN FROM ANOTHER IS KNOWN BY HIS SPEECH THE SIMPLETON BY HIS SILENCE EARLY SHALL HE RISE WHO HAS DESIGNS ON ANOTHERS LAND OR LIFE HIS PREY ESCAPES THE PRONE WOLF THE SLEEPER IS SELDOM VICTORIOUS
EARLY SHALL HE RISE WHO RULES FEW SERVANTS AND SET TO WORK AT ONCE MUCH IS LOST BY THE LATE SLEEPER WEALTH IS WON BY THE SWIFT
A MAN SHOULD KNOW HOW MANY LOGS AND STRIPS OF BARK FROM THE BIRCH TO STOCK IN AUTUMN THAT HE MAY HAVE ENOUGH WOOD FOR HIS WINTER FIRES
WASHED AND FED ONE MAY FARE TO THE THING THOUGH ONES CLOTHES BE THE WORSE FOR WEAR NONE NEED BE ASHAMED OF HIS SHOES OR HOSE NOR OF THE HORSE HE OWNS ALTHOUGH NO THOROUGHBRED
AS THE EAGLE WHO COMES TO THE OCEAN SHORE SNIFFS AND HANGS HER HEAD DUMFOUNDED IS HE WHO FINDS AT THE THING NO SUPPORTERS TO PLEAD HIS CASE
IT IS SAFE TO TELL A SECRET TO ONE RISKY TO TELL IT TO TWO TO TELL IT TO THREE IS THOUGHTLESS FOLLY EVERYONE ELSE WILL KNOW
OFTEN WORDS UTTERED TO ANOTHER HAVE REAPED AN ILL HARVEST TWO BEAT ONE THE TONGUE IS HEADS BANE POCKETS OF FUR HIDE FISTS
MODERATE AT COUNCIL SHOULD A MAN BE NOT BRUTAL AND OVER BEARING AMONG THE BOLD THE BULLY WILL FIND OTHERS AS BOLD AS HE
THESE THINGS ARE THOUGHT THE BEST FIRE THE SIGHT OF THE SUN GOOD HEALTH WITH THE GIFT TO KEEP IT AND A LIFE THAT AVOIDS VICE
NOT ALL SICK MEN ARE UTTERLY WRETCHED SOME ARE BLESSED WITH SONS SOME WITH FRIENDS SOME WITH RICHES SOME WITH WORTHY WORKS
THE HALT CAN MANAGE A HORSE THE HANDLESS A FLOCK THE DEAF BE A DOUGHTY FIGHTER TO BE BLIND IS BETTER THAN TO BURN ON A PYRE THERE IS NOTHING THE DEAD CAN DO
IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE ALIVE THE LIVING CAN KEEP A COW FIRE I SAW WARMING A WEALTHY MAN WITH A COLD CORPSE AT HIS DOOR
A SON IS A BLESSING THOUGH BORN LATE TO A FATHER NO LONGER ALIVE STONES WOULD SELDOM STAND BY THE HIGHWAY IF SONS DID NOT SET THEM THERE
HE WELCOMES THE NIGHT WHO HAS ENOUGH PROVISIONS SHORT ARE THE SAILS OF A SHIP DANGEROUS THE DARK IN AUTUMN THE WIND MAY VEER WITHIN FIVE DAYS AND MANY TIMES IN A MONTH
THE HALF WIT DOES NOT KNOW THAT GOLD MAKES APES OF MANY MEN ONE IS RICH ONE IS POOR THERE IS NO BLAME IN THAT
CATTLE DIE KINDRED DIE EVERY MAN IS MORTAL BUT THE GOOD NAME NEVER DIES OF ONE WHO HAS DONE WELL
CATTLE DIE KINDRED DIE EVERY MAN IS MORTAL BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT NEVER DIES THE GLORY OF THE GREAT DEAD
FIELDS AND FLOCKS HAD FITJUNGS SONS WHO NOW CARRY BEGGING BOWLS WEALTH MAY VANISH IN THE WINK OF AN EYE GOLD IS THE FALSEST OF FRIENDS
IN THE FOOL WHO ACQUIRES CATTLE AND LANDS OR WINS A WOMANS LOVE HIS WISDOM WANES WITH HIS WAXING PRIDE HE SINKS FROM SENSE TO CONCEIT
NOW IS ANSWERED WHAT YOU ASK OF THE RUNES GRAVEN BY THE GODS MADE BY THE ALL FATHER SENT BY THE POWERFUL SAGE LT IS BEST FOR MAN TO REMAIN SILENT
FOR THESE THINGS GIVE THANKS AT NIGHTFALL THE DAY GONE A GUTTERED TORCH A SWORD TESTED THE TROTH OF A MAID ICE CROSSED ALE DRUNK
HEW WOOD IN WINDTIME IN FINE WEATHER SAIL TELL IN THE NIGHTTIME TALES TO HOUSEGIRLS FOR TOO MANY EYES ARE OPEN BY DAY FROM A SHIP EXPECT SPEED FROM A SHIELD COVER KEENNESS FROM A SWORD BUT A KISS FROM A GIRL
DRINK ALE BY THE HEARTH OVER ICE GLIDE BUY A STAINED SWORD BUY A STARVING MARE TO FATTEN AT HOME AND FATTEN THE WATCHDOG
TRUST NOT AN ACRE EARLY SOWN NOR PRAISE A SON TOO SOON WEATHER RULES THE ACRE WIT THE SON BOTH ARE EXPOSED TO PERIL
A SNAPPING BOW A BURNING FLAME A GRINNING WOLF A GRUNTING BOAR A RAUCOUS CROW A ROOTLESS TREE A BREAKING WAVE A BOILING KETTLE A FLYING ARROW AN EBBING TIDE A COILED ADDER THE ICE OF A NIGHT A BRIDES BED TALK A BROAD SWORD A BEARS PLAY A PRINCE S CHILDREN A WITCH S WELCOME THE WIT OF A SLAVE A SICK CALF A CORPSE STILL FRESH A BROTHERS KILLER ENCOUNTERED UPON THE HIGHWAY A HOUSE HALFBURNED A RACING STALLION WHO HAS WRENCHED A LEG ARE NEVER SAFE LET NO MAN TRUST THEM
NO MAN SHOULD TRUST A MAIDENS WORDS NOR WHAT A WOMAN SPEAKS SPUN ON A WHEEL WERE WOMENS HEARTS IN THEIR BREASTS WAS IMPLANTED CAPRICE
TO LOVE A WOMAN WHOSE WAYS ARE FALSE IS LIKE SLEDDING OVER SLIPPERY ICE WITH UNSHOD HORSES OUT OF CONTROL BADLY TRAINED TWOYEAROLDS OR DRIFTING RUDDERLESS ON A ROUGH SEA OR CATCHING A REINDEER WITH A CRIPPLED HAND ON A THAWING HILLSIDE THINK NOT TO DO IT
NAKED I MAY SPEAK NOW FOR I KNOW BOTH MEN ARE TREACHEROUS TOO FAIREST WE SPEAK WHEN FALSEST WE THINK MANY A MAID IS DECEIVED
GALLANTLY SHALL HE SPEAK AND GIFTS BRING WHO WISHES FOR WOMANS LOVE PRAISE THE FEATURES OF THE FAIR GIRL WHO COURTS WELL WILL CONQUER
NEVER REPROACH ANOTHER FOR HIS LOVE IT HAPPENS OFTEN ENOUGH THAT BEAUTY ENSNARES WITH DESIRE THE WISE WHILE THE FOOLISH REMAIN UNMOVED
NEVER REPROACH THE PLIGHT OF ANOTHER FOR IT HAPPENS TO MANY MEN STRONG DESIRE MAY STUPEFY HEROES DULL THE WITS OF THE WISE
THE MIND ALONE KNOWS
